'''4.POLYMORPHISM IN OOPS
ðŸ‘‰ Polymorphism means multiple forms.
It can be achieved through method overriding or overloading.
Method Overloading

Method Overriding

Operator Overloading


'''
#Method of overloding.
class math:
    def add(self,a,b=0,c=0):
        return a+b+c 
m=math()
print(m.add(2,3,8))

'''
Method overloading means same method name with different parameters.
'''

#Method of overriding 
class animal():
    def sound1(self):
        print("Animal sound") 
class dog(animal):
    def sound2(self):
        print("Dog Barks") 
obj = dog()
obj.sound1()
obj.sound2()

'''Method overriding means child class redefines a method from the parent class.'''


'''5.ABSTRACT METHOD IN OOPS

Abstract means hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality.
Acheived abstract using ABC in python

'''
from abc import ABC,abstractmethod

from numpy import number
class shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass 
    class square(number):
        def __init__(self, side):
            self.side = side

        def area(self):
            return self.side ** 2
sq=number(4)
print(sq.area())
