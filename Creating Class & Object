''' ðŸ”° 1. CREATING CLASS & OBJECT EXAMPLES:'''
#Basic creating class and object
class myclass:
    name="Btech"
    age=21
    brach="EEE"
    city="Akkayapalem"
#creating an object 
a=myclass()
print(a.name)
print(a.age)
print(f"hii my name is surendra i from {a.city} and my age is {a.age} and i am studing {a.brach} in {a.name} college")


# mediumlevel to creating class and object 

#creating class bu using constructor
class student:
    def __init__(self,name,age,branch,city):
        self.name=name
        self.age=age
        self.branch=branch
        self.city=city
    def output(self):
        print(f"hii my name is {self.name} i from {self.city} and my age is {self.age} and i am studing {self.branch} in btech college")
a=student("surendra",21,"EEE","Akkayapalem")
a.output() 

#2. CREATING CLASS BY USING CONSTRUCTOR:
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} BOOW BOWW iam a {self.breed}")
d=Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
d.bark()

'''Interview questions on class and object and constructor:

1.âœ…  What is a class in Python?
a class is a blue print for creating an object defining ther properties and methods

2.âœ…  What is an object in Python?
An object is an instance of a class.

3.âœ…  What is the difference between a class and an instance?
A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an instance is a specific object created from that class.

4.âœ…  What is a constructor in Python?
A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.

4. âœ… How do you create an object in Python?
You create an object by calling the class name followed by parentheses. For example: obj = ClassName()

5. âœ…  What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?
The self parameter refers to the instance of the class and is used to access the attributes and methods of the class.
self â†’ Represents current object of the class.
